## Notes on scoring:
You are welcome to include the best json file as a starting point.
Thus, you can continue to improve your score run after run.
Also, you can include it for the remote grade run.
In this way, you can avoid directy time limits on your score.

## Notes on where to run:
If you want to run on a super-computer, 
then you are welcome to request a foundry account:
https://itrss.mst.edu/cluster/foundry/

You can take the json result file from such a run,
and include it in your repo, 
and thus as a start point on the graded run.

You can also run on something like AWS.

## Runnnig the code:
`top_evolve.py` is the actual code for evolving.

`top_display_render.py` is the display,
which can show you the best saved top.

`evolved_pop.json` is the auto-saved population,
which you can choose to re-load between runs.
